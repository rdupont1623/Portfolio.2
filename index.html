          <p class="lead montserrat">I'm Ryan Dupont, a lifelong learner and day-dreamer turned full stack developer. I love sitting with problems, breaking them apart, and desperately trying to find the solution till I'm red in the face. It brings me great joy to work with people that care about what they are doing, and work very hard everyday to achieve who they think they can be. I strive to work with people to make beautiful things. When not bunkered down in a project, you can usually find me in the kitchen, reading, fixing something that is broken, or spending time with friends and family.</p>

        <h3 class="card-title pt-3 esteban">Crypt-ID</h3>
        <p class="card-body montserrat pb-3">This is a full-stack application that a team of three others and I made over the course of two weeks. The intent of the project was to make a forum in which members could share information about the sighting of cryptids, or yet to be proven to exist animals. Once that information has been collected, the hope was to calculate any patterns in the sightings, and through that finally catch Bigfoot. Although that hope did not come to fruition, it was a wonderful exercise in working with databases and HTTP routes. After this project I was a life-time fan of node.js, and all of the different ways that silly sounding tool could facilitate amazing things to be made in simple ways - I wish I could say the same thing about handlebars. Working with this team was a real joy, even if we stayed up till 1 AM too many times. You can view the deployed application by clicking the above image. (And yes, I made the logo animation)</p>

        <h3 class="card-title pt-3 esteban">Enlightenment</h3>
        <p class="card-text montserrat pb-3">This application was my first large project I made with other people. It's a recreational application that allows users to immerse themselves in both poem and art, saving art that they enjoy to be looked at later. To do this we used both a random Poem generator’s API and the Met Museum’s API. As this was my first team coding project, It was a series of real ups and downs. But after toiling with API's and formatting until we knew flexbox like the back of our hands, we all worked together really well and felt proud of the end product.

        <h3 class="card-title pt-3 esteban">Team Member Generator</h3>
        <p class="card-text montserrat pb-3 ">This application was a lot of fun to build, and was one of the first things I made where I really felt like I knew what I was doing. When the application is initialized it asks the user questions through the terminal, which then generates a HTML document that includes the user’s responses. I loved getting to do mostly back-end work that allowed me to get more comfortable with node.js and utilizing npm packages, it made me really appreciate how much they could do. It dawned on me when making this project that coding is using tools within tools to build more tools; it’s a beautiful never ending cycle.
